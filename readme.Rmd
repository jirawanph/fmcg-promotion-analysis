# 📦 FMCG Promotion Effectiveness Analysis

This project analyzes a retail dataset to explore how product categories and discounts affect profit. The goal is to uncover whether high discounts hurt profitability and which product lines are most efficient.

---

## 📊 Business Questions

1. Which sub-categories are most/least profitable?
2. How do discounts influence profit margin?
3. Can we predict profitability using machine learning?

---

## ✅ Key Steps

- Cleaned and prepared the Superstore dataset (999 rows)
- Engineered metrics: profit margin, average discount
- Grouped data by sub-category for financial performance
- Visualized profit margin and discount trends
- Built a logistic regression model to classify profitable transactions

> 📌 Note: Use `encoding='latin-1'` when loading CSV in Python:  
> `df = pd.read_csv('Sample - Superstore.csv', encoding='latin-1')`

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Sub-categories like **Copiers** and **Accessories** have strong margins, while **Tables** show negative profitability.
- **Deep discounts (≥ 40%)** often lead to **loss-making transactions**.
- Many profitable transactions occur at **0–10% discounts**, suggesting opportunities to scale back promotions on resilient items.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Summary

A logistic regression model was trained to classify whether a transaction was profitable (`Profit > 0`).

- **Accuracy:** 94%  
- **Precision (Class 1 - Profitable):** 0.95  
- **Recall (Class 1 - Profitable):** 0.98  
- **F1-score:** 0.96

The model performs exceptionally well at identifying profitable transactions, with a minor tradeoff in false positives for non-profitable ones.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Languages:** R (EDA), Python (ML)
- **Libraries:** dplyr, ggplot2, pandas, scikit-learn
- **Format:** R Markdown (`.Rmd`) → HTML, Colab Notebook (`.ipynb`)
