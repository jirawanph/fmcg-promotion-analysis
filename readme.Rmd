# 📦 FMCG Promotion Effectiveness Analysis

This project analyzes a retail dataset to explore how product categories and discounts affect profit. The goal is to uncover whether high discounts hurt profitability and which product lines are most efficient.

---

## 📊 Business Questions

1. Which sub-categories are most/least profitable?
2. How do discounts influence profit margin?
3. Are there patterns that could help reduce unnecessary discounting?

---

## ✅ Key Steps

- Cleaned and prepared the Superstore dataset (999 rows)
- Engineered metrics: profit margin, average discount
- Grouped data by sub-category for financial performance
- Visualized profit margin and discount trends

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Sub-categories like **Copiers** and **Accessories** have strong margins, while **Tables** show negative profitability.
- **Deep discounts (≥ 40%)** often lead to **loss-making transactions**.
- Many profitable transactions occur at **0–10% discounts**, suggesting opportunities to scale back promotions on resilient items.
